## /// MANIFESTO

**Design is dying.** The web has become a sea of identical, sanitized templates. We are here to break the grid.
This portfolio embraces **Neo-Brutalism**:
- High Contrast
- Raw Typography
- Asymmetrical Layouts
- "Ugly" on Purpose

It's not about being pretty. It's about being **BOLD**.
